Description: singR is a package to extract joint and individual non-gaussian components from different datasets.In neuroimaging, combining information across different modalities, or types of imaging data, can lead to a more comprehensive picture of human brain activity. singR uses an objective function that maximizes the skewness and kurtosis of latent components with a penalty to enhance the similarity between subject scores.Unlike other existed methods, SING does not use PCA for dimension reduction, but rather uses non-Gaussianity, which can improve feature extraction.
